   <li>It is possible to generate larg amounts of data. </li>
   <li>It is possible to add your own files (a value on each row) to generate domain specific data</li>
   <li>It is possible to add Cypher queries and use the result of that to generate data (properties and relations) to or on it.  </li>
   <li>Uses faker library (the non-person functions)</li>
   <li>It is possible to use 'smart properties' which can generate random valid date periods (from and to properties) or a set of Person or User properties</li>
   <li>Besides using a random approach to generate data it is possible to use a sequential approach to generate data.</li>
   <li>You can add any cypher statements before processing and/or after processing. In this way you can for instance combine load csv commands with the generator.</li>
   <li>You can use a 'repeat' lookup structure. This is useful for creating valid 'circular' structures. For instance you want to link persons who live in a city to companies located in the same city.</li>
